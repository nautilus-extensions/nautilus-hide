Nautilus Hide is a simple Python extension for the Nautilus file manager that adds options to the right-click menu to hide or unhide files.

The extension hides the files without renaming them (i.e. without prefixing a dot (.) or suffixing a tilde (~)). It does that by adding their names to the folder's ".hidden" file, which Nautilus reads to hide the listed files the next time you open or refresh the folder.

In Linux, and other UNIX like systems, a file with a name that starts by a dot (.) is considered a hidden file. Some file managers also hide files that end with a tilde (~), with are considered backup files.

To hide an existing file, you would have to rename it. That's not always feasible or desirable.

Some file managers, like Nautilus, offer an alternative way of hiding files: you create a text file that lists, line-by-line, the names of all the files you want to hide and save it in that folder with the name ".hidden". The next time you open or refresh that folder, those files will not be visible.

This extension simply uses that ".hidden" file to hide files. When you choose to hide a file, its name is added to the folder's ".hidden" file. When you choose to unhide it, the name is removed. If the file isn't hidden/unhidden, press F5 to refresh the folder.
